* How to build
Change to the directory where /CMakeLists.txt/ exists, and type in
command line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#+END_SRC

for 32 bits or

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cmake -S . -B build -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#+END_SRC

for 64bits.

When the command above finishes successfully, type

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cmake --build build --target install
#+END_SRC

You will get DelayLoadDll_Test.exe in the bin directory. The pre-built
binaries can be download here: [[https://github.com/YiGeeker/Windows-Hacker-Programming-Demo/releases/tag/Windows-Hacker-Programming][executable files]]
